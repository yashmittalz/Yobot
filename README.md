## TASK AT HAND
To kick off your satellite imagery project, start with a dataset of satellite images. 
Platforms like Kaggle or NASA provide such datasets. 
Then, explore image classification techniques to identify objects or features in the images. 
TensorFlow or PyTorch could be handy for implementation.

For storing the dataset, consider cloud platforms like Google Cloud Storage or AWS S3. 
They offer scalable storage solutions. 

As for the ML software, popular frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch are excellent choices. 
Both provide tools for image classification, perfect for your satellite imagery project.

AstroNLP:
Create a project that involves natural language processing in the field of astronomy. 
You could develop a tool that extracts and summarizes information from astronomical articles, databases, or even social media discussions. 
It could help enthusiasts stay updated on the latest celestial events and discoveries.
